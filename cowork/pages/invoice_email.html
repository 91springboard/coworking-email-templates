            <p><b>GST Update</b></p>
            <p>
              As you all are aware, GST at 18% will be applicable starting 1st July'17. At 91springboard, we follow the
              advance billing cycle and this month is no different. As usual, we expect you to pay by the 1st (as most
              of you already do). However, in case you are unable to pay by the 1st, we would need to reissue the
              invoice with 18% GST as opposed to the 15% service tax. So pay before the 1st to save yourself some money!
              Please note that the amount needs to hit our bank on or before 30th June. Any transfer done after 30th
              June will make it difficult for us to do the necessary reconciliations by the closing date.
            </p>

            <p>Request you to make the payment before the end of this month, to avoid late payment charges.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions with regard to your invoice let us know within the next couple of days before
              the end of the month.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks,</p>
            <p>Team 91springboard</p>
